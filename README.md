# Tiny URL Coding Challenge 
 Created web app modeling [Tiny URL](http://tinyurl.com/), and [Foundry mockup](https://foundrymakes.invisionapp.com/share/M8Q1KJYUQYR#/screens/341626732)

## Getting Started
Open your terminal, and cd into the directory and/or folder you would like to store the project repo. 
<br/>
Once in proper directory, type the command 'git clone' git@github.com:camckin10/tinyapp.git to clone the project repo. 
<br/>
After repo is cloned, type in the command 'npm install.' Npm install will install any packages the project depends on while running. 
<br/>
To start the server for the project, type command 'npm start' into your terminal.
